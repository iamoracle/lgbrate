# LGBRATE


LGBRATE is a fully decentralized LGBTQIA+ community and forum that runs on the CELO blockchain. We provide a platform to organize events, meet other members and donate funds to projects. LGBRATE will liberate LGBTQIA+ communities worldwide especially, in countries where they are persecuted. Members can connect & express their identity without fear and shame. It will also sensitize the public on gender-diversity.
